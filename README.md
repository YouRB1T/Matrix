# Matrix-calculator
## Overview
This program is a straightforward utility for simplifying, calculating, and performing various operations with matrices. The inspiration for this project came after my introduction to algebra at the university; I discovered a gap in available tools as there were no calculators efficient enough to handle the specific matrices our professor assigned. Recognizing this need, I developed this tool to bridge that gap.
